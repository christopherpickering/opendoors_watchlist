        "details": "What does persecution look like in Afghanistan?\nIt is impossible to live openly as a Christian in Afghanistan. Leaving Islam is considered shameful, and Christian converts face dire consequences if their new faith is discovered. Either they must flee the country or they will be killed.\u202fThis was true before the Taliban takeover: the situation has become even more dangerous for believers this year. The Taliban will make sure that Islamic rules and customs are implemented and kept. Christian converts don\u2019t have any option but to obey them.\nIf a Christian\u2019s new faith is discovered, their family, clan or tribe has to save its\u202fhonor\u202fby disowning the believer, or even killing them. This is widely considered to be justice. Alternatively, since leaving Islam is considered a sign of insanity, a Christian who has converted from Islam may be forcibly sectioned in a psychiatric hospital.\nMeet \u201cSharifullah\u201d\n\u201cThe Taliban are killing our souls and spirits.\u201d\nSharifullah (name changed) is a traditional craftsman in Afghanistan. He is a secret believer, who devotes his life to shepherding the people God has entrusted into his care.\nWhat has changed in Afghanistan?\nThe situation in Afghanistan made headlines around the world last year, as the Taliban advanced across the country and captured the capital, Kabul, on August 15, 2021. Many Afghans fled the country, and there was wide expectation that freedoms would be swiftly curtailed. For Christians, though, there were basically no freedoms to lose: Afghanistan had been No. 2 on the Open Doors World Watch List for several years, and Christian persecution remains extreme in all spheres of public and private life. The risk of discovery has increased, since the Taliban controls every aspect of government. This extends to owning documentation\u2014including paperwork from international troops\u2014that may help identify Christians.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nChristians face extreme persecution wherever they are in Afghanistan. Control and supervision are stricter in rural areas than in most cities, but Afghans are expected to be loyal to clan, family and Islam across the country.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help Christians in Afghanistan?\nOpen Doors raises prayer support for persecuted believers in Afghanistan.\nChristian population is Open Doors estimate.",

        "details": "What does persecution look like in North Korea?\nNorth Korea has been at or near the top of the World Watch List for more than 20 years. That\u2019s because any North Korean caught following Jesus is at immediate risk of imprisonment, brutal torture and death. An estimated 50,000 to 70,000 Christians are imprisoned in North Korea\u2019s notorious system of prisons and labor camps. And, to make matters worse, often a family will share the same fate as the person captured. The government ruled by the Kim family views Christians as the most dangerous political class of people, and the persecution is violent and intense. North Korean parents often hide their faith from their children, churches of more than a few people are non-existent, and most worship is done as secretly as possible. Life for Christians in North Korea is a constant cauldron of pressure; capture or death is only a mistake away.\nMeet \u201cBae,\u201d a Christian living in North Korea\n\u201cFrom the perspective of other people, our life of suffering must seem like a cursed life; however, this suffering is a blessing from our Father who allowed it in our life because it is a shortcut to the Father. He knows our suffering and listens to our prayers. We thank our Father who has done such great things to prepare life for us.\u201d\nWhat has changed this year?\nBecause of the government\u2019s closure of all borders as a COVID-19 precaution, Christians are even more at risk. Even the limited ability of some believers to escape to China for help with food and medicine has become even more difficult. In 2021, the government made a rare admission that the situation in North Korea is difficult, which was obvious to international observers who have warned about the impact of failed harvests on the North Korean people. Additionally, experts say North Korea\u2019s network of prison camps has been expanded by at least 20,000 people.\nChristians are, of course, affected by these realities. Where believers are known to authorities for past \u201ccrimes,\u201d like possessing a Bible, they are on the lowest rung of society and neglected for whatever meager food aid is available. North Korea continues to be extremely dangerous for followers of Jesus, and it\u2019s not likely to change any time soon unless the Kim regime is toppled.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nEvery Christian in North Korea is vulnerable and in danger.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help?\nThrough our networks in China, Open Doors helps persecuted North Korean believers with emergency relief aid (food, medicine, clothes, etc.), Bibles, discipleship materials and training, worldwide prayer support and more. Open Doors also provides discipleship through radio broadcasts in other countries that are available (illegally) in North Korea.\nChristian population number is an Open Doors estimate.",

Groups like al-Shabab operate with seemingly little pushback and control large parts of Somali territory. The small number of believers in Somalia are largely Christians who have converted from Islam. Christians are viewed as high-value targets by al-Shabab. Even when Christian converts are not targeted by Islamic extremists, they are intensely pressured by their family. Any conversion from Islam is seen as a betrayal to family and community, so just suspicion of conversion can lead to harassment, intimidation and even murder.

Their neighbors and the rest of the community ostracizes them, and they can be left homeless, jobless and alone. If a Libyan Christian shares his or her faith with someone else, they will likely be reported, arrested and perhaps face violent punishment. The country has no central government, so laws are not enforced uniformly, leaving Christians in danger of overt and public persecution. Targeted kidnappings and executions are always a possibility for believers. To be a \u201csafe\u201d Christian in Libya is to live a secret life of faith.\nMeet \u201cIslem\u201d\nIslem (name changed) lives in a country in North Africa similar to Libya. She saw a Christian woman praising and thanking God on television, and it set her on a path to learn who this Jesus was: \u201cIn Islam, we ask God for things, but we never thank Him.\u201d\u00a0 Today, she is growing in Christ\u2014but in deepest secrecy. While she cannot reveal her faith even to her family members (they would not accept her), she still says, \u201cJesus is like oxygen, because without oxygen you cannot breathe \u2026 No matter what happens in my life, I can\u2019t leave Jesus.\u201d\nWhat has changed this year?\nUnfortunately, the situation in Libya remains the same this year as it has for many years, due in large part to the lack of a central governing authority to break the cycle of armed conflicts in the country. Systemic persecution of anyone who turns from Islam is condoned and expected in Libyan society. Lack of legal protections and changing rules of property ownership have meant even \u201capproved\u201d expatriate congregations that have met in a facility for decades can suddenly face eviction for no reason other than the new owner wants to use the property.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nChristians are vulnerable throughout Libya, whether they live in the country, are passing through for migrant work, or are trying to reach Europe to start a new life. Extremist groups have established checkpoints and control specific areas of the country. Christians who move from area to area looking for work are just as likely to end up in one of the country\u2019s overcrowded detention centers as they are to find jobs. In some cases, Christians who are apprehended are delivered, instead, to criminal officials or human trafficking groups where they are forced into heavy labor or pushed into prostitution.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help?\nOpen Doors works with local partners and churches in North Africa to raise prayer support, training and literature, and advocate for justice for believers. Direct support of persecuted believers through job assistance and provision for practical needs is also key.\nPopulation statistic: Johnson T M and Zurlo G A, eds., World Christian Database (Leiden/Boston: Brill, accessed April 2021).",

They might be arrested or interrogated for their faith, and face threats from both family and Islamic extremists who threaten apostates with death. Yemeni culture is extremely tribal, and often the tribal punishment for denouncing Islam can be death or banishment. Both male and female converts to Christianity who are married to Muslims risk divorce\u2014and may lose custody of their children. Yemen is home to one of the greatest humanitarian crises in the world, and all Yemenis suffer\u2014but Yemeni Christians are additionally vulnerable, since emergency relief is mostly distributed through local Muslim leaders and local mosques. These groups have been accused of discriminating against anyone who is not considered to be a devout Muslim.\nMeet \u201cNaser\u201d\n\u201cWe, the believers, carry hope that helps us with the certainty that tomorrow will be better and that by the will of our Lord, we will pass through this and all the anxieties and fears surrounding us.\u201d\nWhat has changed this year?\nThe persecution against Christians in Yemen has continued to be extreme for years, and it\u2019s risen two spots on the 2022 World Watch List from last year\u2019s List. Pressure on converts from Islam is at the highest levels in every part of life. Christians in Yemen continue to face physical and mental abuse, sexual harassment and rape, as well as forced marriages and expulsion for faith-related reasons. Additionally, the presence of Islamic extremist groups\u2014and the continuing destabilization of the COVID-19 pandemic and the civil war\u2014has made daily life a struggle for most of Yemen\u2019s Christians.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nLife is dangerous for all Christians in Yemen. But some believers in certain areas are at particular risk, such as Christians living in the south, where there is a strong al-Qaeda presence. Converts from Islam to Christianity have also indicated that there is more pressure in the Shiite Muslim-controlled areas in the west than in areas under control of the Sunni government. The Shiite-controlled areas\u2014which comprise approximately one-third of Yemen\u2019s territory\u2014are heavily policed: any dissenting opinion is rigorously repressed and likely to lead to imprisonment, torture and possibly worse.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help?\nOpen Doors supports the Body of Christ around the Arabian Peninsula through prayer, the distribution of biblical resources and the training of believers and pastors.

Those not part of these groups are at risk of severe persecution at the hands of the state. Gatherings are raided and believers arrested. The conditions facing Christians in prison can be inhumane. Some pastors have been incarcerated for over a decade and have faced solitary confinement. There are possibly more than 1,000 Christians imprisoned in Eritrea, with none formally charged. While some are released, many of these are moved to military service\u2014which is no freedom at all\u2014or house arrest. The ongoing detention of Christians shows that the government has no intention of relaxing its repressive policies.\nChristians not recognized by the state are especially vulnerable to the everyday surveillance imposed by the state, with phone calls\u202f monitored, bandwidth kept slow and a network of citizens tasked with spying on their neighbors. This intrusive level of monitoring has led to Eritrea holding the infamous title of \u201cAfrica\u2019s North Korea\u201d (The Economist, Aug. 14, 2018).\nMeanwhile, converts from Islam and the Eritrean Orthodox Church face harsh mistreatment from their families and communities.\nMeet \u201cShiden\u201d\nShiden was imprisoned for more than a decade\u2014simply for worshiping Jesus.

In much of northern Nigeria, Christians live their lives under the constant threat of attack from Boko Haram, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), Fulani militants and criminals who kidnap and murder with few consequences. While all citizens of northern Nigeria are subject to threats and violence, Christians are often specifically targeted because of their faith\u2014ISWAP and Boko Haram want to eliminate the Christian presence in Nigeria, and Muslim Fulani militants attack Christian villages specifically. In addition to the violence risks, Christians in some of Nigeria\u2019s northern states also live under Shariah law, where they face discrimination and treatment as second-class citizens. Christians who convert from Islam also face rejection from their families, often pressured to recant their faith in Jesus; sometimes, they are even violently attacked.\nMeet \u201cRose\u201d\n\u201cWhen I lost my husband, my in-laws never cared about me; they didn\u2019t come to check on me or the children. When [our daughter] Patience died, I thought they would rally around me, but nobody came. I felt so pained in my heart \u2026 But I decided to let go of my bitterness and let God heal me.\u201d\nWhat has changed this year?\nChristians continue to be attacked indiscriminately and brutally in northern Nigeria, and Nigeria\u2019s rank has risen accordingly. The violence has continued unabated\u2014one of the only places in the world where COVID-19 travel restrictions and lockdowns had little impact on attacks against Christians. Christians in northern Nigeria remain at risk of daily pressure and discrimination, as well. The attacks and insecurity have also spread to southern Nigeria. Fulani militants and other violent actors have settled into southern forests, making it difficult for Christian farmers to access their land.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nIn many ways, vulnerability depends on where in Nigeria a Christian lives. Remote villages in Nigeria\u2019s Middle Belt region are at risk of attacks from Fulani militants or other violent actors, and these attacks have even spread into southern Nigeria. In the northeast, any community of believers is at risk of attack from Boko Haram or ISWAP. Because of the violence, thousands of Christians are forced to live in formal or informal camps for internally displaced people (IDPs). This situation contributes to the vulnerability, because people who have lost their home or loved ones are now effectively refugees within their own country. Women and girls tend to have higher levels of vulnerability as well\u2014and anyone who converts from Islam to Christianity is likely most vulnerable of all.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help Christians in Nigeria?\nOpen Doors partners with the local church in northern Nigeria to strengthen, support, equip and provide assistance to persecuted believers through trauma counseling (including a trauma center), Bibles and discipleship training, socio-economic aid, literacy projects and worldwide prayer support.\nPopulation statistic: Johnson T M and Zurlo G A, eds., World Christian Database (Leiden/Boston: Brill, accessed April 2021).",

Pakistan\u2019s infamous blasphemy laws continue to be leveraged to accuse non-Muslims (or minority Muslim sects) of insulting the Prophet Mohammed or the Quran\u2014even a false accusation can lead to mob violence.

Violence against Christians for their faith continues to happen at extreme levels, but discrimination and pressure are daily realities for Christians throughout the country. The COVID-19 pandemic led to a campaign where hardline Islamists tied food aid to conversions, and Christian hospital workers were sent to COVID-19 wards with no protective gear, because they are viewed as expendable. Christians can be taunted for wearing a cross necklace, accusations of blasphemy can happen because of Facebook posts (and lead to violent mob reprisals) and anyone who converts from Islam is viewed as an apostate.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nSince most Christians live in Punjab Province, many incidents of persecution, discrimination and intolerance occur there. However, next to Punjab, the province of Sindh is also notorious for being a hotspot for bonded labor, affecting many Christians as well. All Christians in Pakistan are potential victims of abuse and discrimination, but anyone caught converting from Islam bears the brunt of persecution in Pakistan.

Under the amendments, teaching the Bible or telling others about the Christian faith\u2014which contradicts the teaching of Islam\u2014could result in prosecution, as could the claim that Christians can communicate with Jesus, whom Islamic teaching regards as a prophet. Christians could also be accused of \u201cinsults \u2026 with the intent to cause violence or tensions.\u201d This vague wording is open to interpretation, making Christians more vulnerable to unjust accusations.\nFurther challenges may ensue following the swearing in of Ebrahim Raisi as the country\u2019s new president in August 2021, succeeding Hassan Rouhani. He\u2019s seen as a hardliner with ultra-conservative Islamic views.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nConverts from Islam to Christianity are most at risk of persecution, especially by the government, and to a lesser extent, by society and their own families.\nGovernment control is highest in urban areas, while rural areas are less monitored. However, the anonymity of urban areas gives Christians more freedom to organize meetings and activities than in rural areas, in which social control is higher.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help?\nOpen Doors supports the church in Iran through partners with online ministry presence, Christian multimedia initiatives and advocacy.\nNumber of Christians statistic is an Open Doors estimate .",

The COVID-19 pandemic made this reality even more obvious, as spikes in infections tended to center in migrant communities where sanitation and social distancing were much more difficult. Christian foreign workers can be targeted for their faith, since it\u2019s another way to abuse a worker. Foreign Christians are heavily restricted from sharing their faith or gathering for worship, and any actions outside of the norm can lead to detention and deportation.\nThere are converts from Islam in Saudi Arabia. Those who came from majority-Muslim countries likely live and work in communities that reflect the cultural norms of their home\u2014so they can be at risk if their social context is opposed to conversion. The few converts who are Saudi Arabian are usually forced to live out their faith in secrecy, risking violence, divorce and more.

        "details": "What does persecution look like in Sudan?\nSince the 2019 coup that ousted Omar al-Bashir, who ruled Sudan for 30 years, the situation for Sudanese Christians has somewhat improved in the sense that the government has changed its policy of considering Christians enemies and agents of the West. However, there are systematic issues that affect Christians. First, while government policy has changed, social attitudes about Christians have not, especially outside Khartoum. There, the culture and surrounding society are still majority-Muslim and suspicious of any other faith. Second, the government has not put real protections into place for Christians and other religious minorities. For example, even with the change in official status, confiscated churches and lands have yet to be returned to their Christian owners; and trying to build new churches is still extremely difficult. And finally, there are still high-level military leaders who have slowed reform.\nMeet \u201cAbdul,\u201d a Christian in Sudan\n\u201cThere are many churches who applied [to build] more than five years ago and some others two years ago, at the beginning of the current transitional government, hoping to be treated equal [to Muslims]. \u2026 The minister of religious affairs spoke on TV and at other events and said that Christians would be able to build new churches; however there is always contradiction between his words and real life.\u201d\nWhat has changed this year?\nPersecution remains incredibly high in Sudan and hasn\u2019t changed much in the last year. Churches were burned down and Christians reported being beaten or attacked during the World Watch List reporting period. Ongoing ethnic violence in the Darfur region also worries many observers who wonder if the transitional government can actually protect minorities. While the positive developments that occurred after al-Bashir\u2019s ouster are worth celebrating, it remains to be seen how much change will actually take place in reality. Christians are still at significant risk from society at large, particularly if they have converted from Islam. Additionally, armed groups who were part of the former dictatorship continue to be active, posing a constant threat to Christians.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nChristians outside of the capital city of Khartoum remain most at risk. But all of Sudanese society is still largely opposed to public expressions of Christianity, and despite gains at the national level, reform can be hard to come by at the local level. Christians who convert from Islam face additional risks from family and community.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help?\nThrough partnerships with the local church, Open Doors equips church leaders in Sudan for various aspects of ministry, supports community development and provides practical assistance to persecuted Christians.\nPopulation statistic: Johnson T M and Zurlo G A, eds., World Christian Database (Leiden/Boston: Brill, accessed April 2021).",

In June 2020, Christian villages were bombed in Turkey\u2019s largest operation in the area since 2015, forcing many Christians to flee. In May 2021, Christian villages were evacuated following Turkish bombing in the region. Christians were not protected by the local government.\nMany Christians are also seriously affected by intolerance and persecution. This is perpetuated mostly by militant Islamic groups and non-Christian leaders. They also face discrimination from government authorities.\nIn central and southern Iraq, Christians often do not publicly display Christian symbols (such as crosses) as this can lead to harassment or discrimination at checkpoints, universities, workplaces and government buildings. Outspoken believers in the region have frequently become targets. Blasphemy laws can be used against Christians suspected of carrying out outreach among Muslims.\nChristians from a Muslim background experience most pressure from their families. They often keep their faith a secret, as they risk being threatened by family members, clan leaders and their local community. Converts risk losing their inheritance rights and the right or means to marry.\nMeet Matti\nMatti, whose ID card states he\u2019s a Muslim despite growing up as a Christian, says: \u201cOne day when I die, I will die as a Christian.\u201d\nWhat has changed this year?\nPersecution levels in Iraq have largely remained the same. However, encouragingly, in the last year there has been a substantial drop in reported incidents of violence.\nMeanwhile, Iraqi politicians have passed a bill to make Christmas Day a national holiday, and a committee has been set up to enable Christians displaced by the Islamic State group insurgency to return to their homes (more than 80% have fled the country since 2003). However, many Christians are reluctant to return home, as they do not yet feel the environment is conducive for a safe and prosperous return.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nMost Christians in Iraq live in the north of the country, in Kurdistan.

But leaders of other Christian groups are also vulnerable because they may be more active in evangelism. Church buildings are completely destroyed in many parts of Syria where Islamic extremists had control (or continue to maintain control). Where extremists control territory, any public expression of faith is dangerous. Additionally, every Christian in Syria lives with the constant realization that Islamic extremists have not necessarily left Syria\u2014they\u2019ve just retreated into the shadows, and they may return to public life again in the future.\nAs the Christian population of Syria has diminished due to the civil war, more and more Syrian Christians come from a Muslim background.

Locals are on the watch for anything that deviates from Maldivian belief\u2014particularly conversion from Islam to another faith. Conversion will be reported to Muslim leaders or authorities; non-Muslims can also lose their citizenship.

These believers are also watched by authorities, making it difficult for even foreign migrant Christians to fellowship. And although the Islamic culture is ultra-conservative, even more Muslim extremist groups have returned to the country, placing Christian converts at further risk.\nWhat has changed this year?\nThe level of pressure on Christians remained very high. Converts have no space at all to live out their Christian faith and expatriate Christians (often migrant workers) lack possibilities for worshiping together without fearing arrest and deportation. The new government, which took over in mid-November 2018, has made no tangible improvements as regards freedom of religion and is more focused on internal political struggles.

Native Qatari converts are the most vulnerable to danger, while foreign Christians may be somewhat freer to worship, as long as they do so in ways the government can tolerate.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help?\nOpen Doors raises prayer support for Christians in Qatar.\nPopulation statistic: Johnson T M and Zurlo G A, eds., World Christian Database (Leiden/Boston: Brill, accessed February 2020).",

        "details": "What does persecution look like in Vietnam?\nThe level of persecution Vietnamese Christians experience may depend on their particular denomination or background. Historical Christian communities (like Roman Catholic churches) enjoy a certain amount of freedom\u2014unless they become politically active, which can lead to the imprisonment of church leaders. But evangelical and charismatic Protestants\u2014along with converts from indigenous religions\u2014often face intense pressure and violence for their faith, especially in the remote areas of central and northern Vietnam. Christians are harassed in the workplace and may face discrimination for their faith, while Christian children are ostracized at school and may be pressured to reject their faith.\nince religion is closely identified with ethnicity in these regions, leaving a traditional belief for Christianity may be seen as wholesale rejection of culture and community. Therefore, Christians who belong to the country\u2019s ethnic minorities often face social exclusion, discrimination and attacks. Their homes are sometimes destroyed, and they are then forced to leave their villages. Sometimes, the local communities will leverage the absolute power of the local communist government to persecute Christians who stray outside of the traditional belief system.\nMeet \u201cPoh,\u201d a Hmong Christian who was kicked out of his village for his conversion to Christianity\n\u201cA few months ago, I went back to my old village to visit my parents and siblings, but my family and the villagers still hate me\u2014they forbade me from going near them. My parents still despise me and have renounced me as their child.\u201d\nWhat has changed this year?\nThe level of persecution stayed largely the same in Vietnam during the 2022 World Watch List reporting period. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to affect all residents of the country, and some Christians in rural areas reported discrimination in government pandemic assistance. Ethnic minority Christians still face violence and social consequences when they convert to Christianity, and the Vietnamese church remains under pressure throughout the country.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nPressure and violence targeting Christians among ethnic minorities is especially strong in the central and northwestern highlands of Vietnam. Christians who leave their tribal religions to follow Jesus are viewed as cultural and family traitors\u2014they\u2019re at risk for violent attack, having their children forcibly taken and having their homes and crops destroyed.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help?\nOpen Doors works through local church partners to come alongside Vietnamese believers when they suffer physical attacks and expulsion from their families and communities for choosing to follow Christ. We do this through advocacy, relief and practical aid, along with biblical training and discipleship programs.\nPopulation statistic: Johnson T M and Zurlo G A, eds., World Christian Database (Leiden/Boston: Brill, accessed April 2021).",

Incidents range from Christian women being harassed while walking in a street to whole communities of Christians being forced to move out of their homes by mobs of Muslim extremists. Such events typically happen in Upper Egypt, where ultra-conservative Islamic Salafist movements are active in rural communities.\nChristians are typically treated as second-class citizens. While Egypt\u2019s government speaks positively about the Christian community, the lack of serious law enforcement and the unwillingness of local authorities to protect Christians leave them vulnerable to all kinds of attacks. The dictatorial nature of the regime means Christians feel unable to speak out against these practices.\nChurches and Christian groups face many difficulties when trying to construct new buildings. The hindrances come both from state restrictions and from communal hostility and mob violence.\nChristians from a Muslim background face enormous pressure from their families to return to Islam. The state also makes it impossible for them to get any official recognition of their conversion.\nMeet \u201cSara,\u201dwho survived a knife attack by a Muslim extremist who said to her, \u201cDirty Christian, die!\u201d\n\u201cIf someone is willing to kill me for my faith, my God must be powerful.\u201d\nWhat has changed this year\nThe challenges facing Christians in Egypt remain largely unchanged, although there has been a drop in levels of violence. This is most likely linked to COVID-19 restrictions\u2014Christian activities have significantly decreased, which invites less provocation, and would-be perpetrators have been off the streets due to lockdowns.\nThe biggest threat for converts from Islam to Christianity continues to come from family members\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nMost incidents of persecution take place in Upper Egypt, which is known to be more conservatively Islamic and extremist than the north. The Minya Governorate is notorious for the high number of attacks on Christians. However, believers in the economically disadvantaged rural areas in the north experience a similar degree of oppression. Islamic extremist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood have nationwide support, but violent Islamic militants are only openly active in the northeastern area of the Sinai peninsula.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help?\nOpen Doors works through local partners in Egypt to support the church with literacy training, education, advocacy support, medical care and youth, family and women\u2019s ministry.\nChristian population statistic is an Open Doors estimate.",

Christians who are a part of these non-registered churches may be viewed as \u201cextremists,\u201d and the government believes church members are spies trying to destroy the government. Therefore, Christians and their churches may be monitored, and unregistered churches may be the victims of police raids, arrests and fines. Additionally, Uzbekistan is largely Muslim, so any Christian who converted from Islam faces increased pressure from their family and community. Christians in these situations may be locked up, beaten or expelled from their communities. Many converts from Islam are forced to hide their faith.\nMeet \u201cAdam,\u201d who attends a church that tried to register with the Uzbek government\n\u201cThe police asked us why we became Christians and demanded we renounce our faith. This had never happened before, even when we were fined in previous years. This happened because we asked for registration.\u201d\nWhat has changed this year?\nThis year, persecution continued to be significant against Christians in Uzbekistan. A new criminal code was drafted in 2021, which continues to penalize the distribution of religious literature, meeting for worship without government permission and \u201ctalking about faith.\u201d The previous laws about religious activity were often criticized for being vague, but this update gives way to even greater persecution. Protestant churches continue to be targeted by authorities, and Christians who converted from Islam are still persecuted by both government and community.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nThe level of persecution by government officials in Uzbekistan is the same all over the country, particularly on Christians who don\u2019t belong to a registered church, as well as Christians suspected of evangelizing. For Christians who converted from Islam, the pressure is strongest outside of urban areas, especially in the Fergana Valley in the east.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help?\nWe can\u2019t talk specifically about work in Uzbekistan for security reasons.

Laws regulating non-Muslim worship ban anything that would \u201cshake the faith of a Muslim\u201d or be used as \u201ca means of seduction intending to convert a Muslim to another religion.\u201d A 2006 law repressing worship remains in place, despite a new constitution being introduced in November 2020.\nDuring the past year, several Christians were prosecuted and imprisoned on blasphemy and proselytizing charges. Algerian authorities are also waging an ongoing, systematic campaign against the Protestant church: 13 churches that had previously been forcibly sealed remain closed, and another three were forced to shut down.\nMost Christians in the country are converts from Islam and, as with most countries in North Africa, these believers face strong opposition from their family and community. This can involve harassment, beatings, threats and imprisonment, as well as pressure to adhere to Islamic norms and rites. The pressure and danger faced by Christians is particularly high in the Arab, rural and religiously more conservative parts of the country. In the 1990s, these regions acted as a stronghold for Islamist insurgents in the fight against the government.\nMeet Pastor Rachid\n\u201cThis is purely an attack against us Algerian Christians and the churches.\u201d\nPastor Rachid leads a church and runs a bookshop, where he sells Bibles and other Christian books. In February 2021, he and his assistant Nouh were convicted of proselytizing and selling books that \u201cshake the faith of Muslims,\u201d and given prison sentences. Rachid\u2019s church was forcibly closed and sealed in July 2021.\nWhat has changed this year?\nAlthough no churches were closed in 2020, in 2021, three (in the Oran region) were forcibly shut down. Despite appeals from the Algerian church, no churches have been re-opened: the legacy of previous years of persecution remains high in the country.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nIn the Arab part of the country, especially the south, life is particularly hard for Christians and the number of churches is very low. Violent Islamic extremists don\u2019t have a wide support base among the people, but Islam holds a firm grip over the country. The majority of Christians live in the Kabyle region in north Algeria.

Though some Christians have trickled back in with police protection, there are areas where there are no Christians. The trauma lingers, and the threat of attack still hangs over Christians, making evangelistic activities especially risky. Such programs can draw the attention of jihadists, and Christian missionaries live under the constant fear of abduction. Anyone who converts from Islam risks personal violence and pressure from their relatives if their faith is discovered. Northern Mali is also unsafe for non-governmental organizations.\nMeet \u201cNaomi\u201d\n\u201cMore than once, my family sent jihadists to my house to kill [or at least intimidate] us. Their plans never worked. But one day, while my husband was on a business trip, he was gunned down. He was killed for his faith and for marrying an ex-Muslim. His colleagues delivered the terrible news to me. [Even now], I have no idea what happened to his body.\u201d\nWhat has changed in Mali?\nThe situation in Mali has become complex, and it\u2019s difficult to distinguish clearly between religious-based and ethnic-based violence. Pressure and violence are both significant threats for believers. Though violence slightly decreased since last year\u2019s list, pressure from the community and against the church have both risen.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nChristians in the northern regions of Mali\u2014where jihadists and extremist Muslim Fulani herdsmen are active\u2014experience the most difficulties for their faith. To some extent, there are small pockets of intense persecution in the southern part of the country as well.

        "details": "What does persecution look like in Turkmenistan?\nIn Turkmenistan, persecution against Christians comes from most parts of society. The government heavily restricts religious freedom, going so far as to make it extremely difficult to print or import religious materials. While unregistered churches are most heavily targeted, even Russian Orthodox and Armenian Apostolic churches are monitored by authorities. In addition to official pressure, Christians who have converted from Islam are also pressured by their families and their communities. Some Christian converts are even the victims of violence, all in an effort to try to coerce new believers into renouncing their faith in Jesus.\nMeet Pastor Ilmurad\nPastor Ilmurad from Turkmenistan was sentenced to four years imprisonment, falsely accused of fraud. While he was in prison, he was told that he would be released if he denied his Christian faith, but he refused. He had to do hard labor during his imprisonment and sleep on a concrete floor.\nHe was released in 2012, and Open Doors\u2019 local partners recently had contact with Ilmurad again. It has taken time for him to heal after his hard experiences in prison, but he has largely recovered. He is still a pastor and helps people in his town.\nIlmurad is still thankful for all the support\u00a0and prayers\u00a0he received from\u00a0his fellow brothers and sisters around the world.\nWhat has changed this year?\nNot much has changed in Turkmenistan, though it fell slightly in the rankings. Turkmenistan has continued to function as if the COVID-19 pandemic does not exist. This is another area where the authoritarian system of government has operated outside of reality and the care of its people. Similarly, the country continues to treat religious freedoms as optional, making it extremely difficult to follow Jesus in Turkmenistan. The government cracks down on anything it perceives might be a threat to its rule, including expressions of Christianity that leaders feel they can\u2019t control. Christians who converted from Islam continue to experience significant pressure from family and society, and most of the reports of violence against Christians have stemmed from that reality.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nChurch leaders in Turkmenistan are especially targeted for persecution. Muslims consider them primarily responsible for leading people away from Islam and attack those they deem to be most active evangelistically. The government sees leaders as primary targets to control Christian activities. All Christians experience some level of rights violations, but Christian converts from Islam are certainly the most impacted by direct violence. Additionally, persecution is worse outside of urban areas, though the government\u2019s persecution extends into every corner of Turkmenistan.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help?\nWe can\u2019t talk specifically about work in Turkmenistan for security reasons.

        "details": "What does persecution look like in Indonesia?\nThe persecution of Christians in Indonesia has worsened in recent years. There were three attacks on Christians within a six-month period between 2020 and 2021, killing eight believers, while Indonesian society has taken on a more conservative Islamic character, putting added pressure on Christians.\nMany converts from Islam experience pressure from their families to return to Islam, although the intensity of the pressure varies according to the place and the individual\u2019s family. Only a few converts face physical violence for their Christian faith. There are also converts from Hinduism in Bali.\nChurches that engage in evangelistic outreach are at risk of being targeted by Islamic extremist groups. There are certain hotspots, such as West Java or Aceh, where extremist groups are strong and exert a strong influence on society and politics.\nIn some regions, church groups face difficulties getting permission to build churches. Even if they manage to fulfill all legal requirements (including winning court cases), the local authorities still often ignore them.\nMeet \u201cWanda\u201d\nWanda comes from a Muslim background. She became a Christian through a dream and the ministry of her cousin and friend. But she encountered persecution from her family, and was forced to move out. When COVID-19 hit, she struggled to provide for herself, until Open Doors local partners stepped in to help. \n\u201cOne thing that I am so overwhelmed with is the love from my Christian friends. I feel like I have a new family, when my biological family abandoned me. I don\u2019t feel alone in this new journey of my life.\u201d\nWhat has changed?\nSadly, the persecution of Christians in Indonesia has worsened considerably, making it one of the biggest risers on the World Watch List, jumping 19 places from last year.\nWhile pressure has increased in the national and church spheres, the main cause of this rise is an increase in violence.\nAfter two years without bomb attacks, suicide bombers targeted a church in Makassar in March 2021; thankfully, no one was killed. However, eight Christians were killed in two attacks in Central Sulawesi in November 2020 and May 2021. The terrorist group East Indonesia Mujahidin (MIT)\u2014which has links to the Islamic State group\u2014is responsible for the attacks.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nThe primary hotbed of persecution in Indonesia is Aceh in the northwestern tip of Sumatra, the only province that is governed by Shariah law. Churches were closed on a large scale in October 2015 and the building of new churches there is much more difficult than in other provinces. In fact, it is virtually impossible. Converts from Islam are vulnerable to severe opposition in many parts of Indonesia, but converts in Aceh probably face the greatest pressure.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help?\nOpen Doors works through local church partners to support persecuted Christians in Indonesia by providing discipleship and persecution survival training, Bibles and Christian literature, socio-economic development projects, relief aid, advocacy support and opportunities for cross-church gatherings.\nPopulation statistic: Johnson T M and Zurlo G A, eds., World Christian Database (Leiden/Boston: Brill, accessed April 2021).",

Bangladesh\u2019s northern region and Chittagong Hill Tracts are often overlooked hotspots for persecution against Christians at the hands of both the Muslim majority and the Buddhist minority.\nThe arrival of 700,000 Rohingya refugees from neighboring Myanmar in the past four years has led to thousands of people living in refugee camps, and repatriation or integration efforts have constantly stalled.

        "details": "What does persecution look like in Colombia?\nThough Colombia has a high percentage of Christians, believers still face persecution from criminal gangs and indigenous groups. Guerrilla groups threaten, harass, extort and even murder church leaders, who are targeted because they denounce corruption, defend human rights and oppose cartels. Their children may also be targeted, to discourage church leaders from speaking out against organized crime and corruption. These forms of persecution are particularly prevalent in rural and remote areas of Colombia.\nThe humanitarian crisis in the Pacific Coast region continues to worsen: the fight for the control of illicit crops, drug trafficking and illegal mining have led to intensified conflict. Many Christians are affected, and are among the thousands of displaced families.\nIn indigenous communities, persecution tends to focus on Christians who have converted from the beliefs of their indigenous tribe. These Christians face imprisonment, harassment, physical abuse, denial of basic rights and use of their ancestral territory, or being sent away to do forced labour in a different territory, among other forms of persecution. Often they are targeted to make an example of them, so that the rest of the community is deterred from conversion.\nAnother key driver of persecution is secular intolerance. Increasingly, Christians are facing hostility, verbal abuse and discrimination for their stance on issues such as abortion, sexuality and gender orientation. The participation of Christians in the political sphere as diminished as a result.\nMeet Daniela, whose father was murdered for his faith\n\u201cI learned that, although there are difficult times in life, there are also times when Jesus helps us to overcome through people and prayer.\u201d\nWhat has changed this year?\nLast year saw protests in Colombia, partly against corruption and controversial government measures. Church leaders were among those who supported the demonstrators, and this led to threats and violence. Overall, there has been a small increase in the persecution faced from the wider community and a small decrease in the incidents of violence, but persecution has not significantly changed in Colombia in the past year. Violence remains high, with seven Christians killed for their faith between January and September 2021.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nChristians who\u2019ve converted from an indigenous religion are most vulnerable to persecution in some regions of Colombia. Elsewhere, Christians\u2014and particularly church leaders and their families\u2014are most at risk in areas dominated by guerrilla gangs and drug cartels. Furthermore, rising secular intolerance means Christians are increasingly vulnerable to hostility, verbal abuse and discrimination for speaking out on certain issues.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help?\nOpen Doors strengthens the persecuted church in Colombia through Bible distribution, training, trauma care, community development projects, emergency relief aid, and education and safe houses for children.\nPopulation statistic: Johnson T M and Zurlo G A, eds., World Christian Database (Leiden/Boston: Brill, accessed April 2021).",

Since 2013, CAR has been embroiled in conflict and fighting, and most of the country is occupied by armed militia groups that are responsible for a wide range of human rights abuses. When Christian leaders publicly have denounced the violence, they have been threatened and their churches ransacked and torched. Conflict in the country has resulted in thousands of Christians losing their homes and livelihoods, and many continue to live in Internally Displaced People (IDP) camps.\nConverts to Christianity face further pressure from family members. Women and girls can be put under house arrest to prevent them from meeting with other Christians,\u00a0or forcibly married to a much older Muslim.\u00a0There are reports that sometimes a Christian mother\u00a0is only allowed\u00a0to attend Christian gatherings\u00a0on condition that her children are sent to the mosque.

This is compounded by a rise in disruption and opposition to church life. Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis is worsening in the country, and in June 2021, was at a five-year low\u2014which makes life even harder for vulnerable believers.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nPersecution against Christians is most severe in the northern and eastern parts of the country, where Muslims are a majority and splinter-groups of the rebel alliance S\u00e9l\u00e9ka are operating.

There are over 1 million internally displaced people in Burkina Faso, many of whom are Christians.\nBelievers who\u2019ve converted from Islam face the most persecution.

Believers from Muslim backgrounds are therefore the most vulnerable to persecution, and often come under intense pressure from their families and communities to renounce their faith.\nHistorical Christian communities are generally allowed to practice their faith in private, but in regions under Islamist control, Christians must gather with caution because of an increased threat of violence from militant groups like Boko Haram. In regions near the border with Nigeria, churches have been burned and pastors forced to flee their homes. Meanwhile, the local authorities have occasionally stopped believers from meeting, and the registration process for churches is long and difficult.\nWhat has changed this year?\nThe persecution dynamic is changing rapidly in Niger, with the country jumping 21 places to enter the World Watch List top 50. This is due to a dramatic rise in violence against Christians. In the past five years, the Sahel region has seen a huge increase in violent Islamist attacks, and the government of Niger has lost a lot of territory to the jihadists. Since 2020, the country has been experiencing a series of attacks by Islamic militants and protesters also at times take their revenge by burning churches. The unpredictability of the situation makes Christians vulnerable.\nThe pandemic\u2014which has enabled Islamic militants to expand their influence in Niger\u2014is likely a contributing factor in this latest rise. More widely, this trend reflects the increasing violence facing Christians across sub-Saharan Africa.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nThose who convert to Christianity from a Muslim background face the most pressure from family and society. Christians living in areas under Islamist control or in the region bordering Nigeria are most susceptible to violent attacks, as are those living in the west where Niger borders Burkina Faso and Mali.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help?\nOpen Doors works through local churches and partners in Niger to strengthen persecuted Christians through economic empowerment programs, leadership and discipleship training, persecution survival training and pastoral care for new believers.\nChristian population stat: Johnson T M and Zurlo G A, eds, World Christian Database (Leiden/Boston: Brill, accessed April 2021)",

While expatriate Christians are largely left alone, for Tunisian believers, pressure is high in every aspect, and the unseen difficulties of following Jesus in Tunisia impact believers around the North African nation. The situation is particularly dire for Christians who have converted from Islam. They face hostility and abuse from their families and their surrounding community. It can be dangerous to share their faith, so many of them are forced to worship Jesus secretly.

The government reacts harshly against opposition voices and demonstrators, and so when church leaders or Christian activists criticize the regime, they face arrest, closure of their churches or businesses, prison sentences, and harassment by the government and its sympathizers.\nNew churches are often denied registration, as the authorities want to control and limit the church\u2019s influence\u2014forcing many churches to operate illegally. This leads to the imposition of penalties, such as the complete refusal to issue licenses, heavy fines, confiscation of property or even the demolition or closure of churches, including house churches. The government controls all media and restricts access from the outside world, so it is very hard for Christians to communicate widely in the country.\nMeet Pastor \u201cJorge\u201d\n\u201cGovernment officials have joined some of the WhatsApp groups the churches have set up, and they do so to monitor our activities.\u201d\nWhat has changed this year?\nPersecution in Cuba continues to worsen. Last year, Cuba was just outside the top 50 countries on the World Watch List (at 51), and the previous year it was 61. The continued rise is the result of highly restrictive measures against churches deemed to be opponents of the regime\u2014especially non-registered Protestant churches. The COVID-19 crisis has been used as a pretext to hinder church and community activities, monitor church leaders, make arbitrary arrests, confiscate private property and impose extortion fees. Christian leaders from different denominations were among those arrested during anti-government demonstrations in July.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nChurch leaders and others who speak out against the Communist regime are most vulnerable to persecution in Cuba.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help?\nOpen Doors partners strengthen the persecuted church in Cuba through Bible distribution, livelihood projects, biblical training, leadership development projects and socio-economic development to increase the self-reliance of the church.\nPopulation statistic: Johnson T M and Zurlo G A, eds., World Christian Database (Leiden/Boston: Brill, accessed April 2021).",

Meanwhile, political violence in the country\u2014focused largely around the conflict in Tigray\u2014has also taken its toll on Christian communities, with many Christians killed and churches destroyed. The country has also been gravely affected by drought and plagues. All of these issues create uncertainty, making Christians a soft target.\nPressure can also come from the government. In areas where Muslims or Ethiopian Orthodox Christians are in the majority, local officials may oppose the growth of Protestant Christianity and refuse to grant permits for meetings and worship.\nMeet \u201cRoda\u201d\nRoda became a Christian after attending Bible studies.

Once noticed, the persecution began, but Roda continues to bravely stand firm in her faith.\n\u201cFrom now on, I will bow down to the Messiah, the One who has saved me.\u201d\nWhat has changed this year?\nBroadly speaking, pressure on Christians in Ethiopia has intensified, despite the country dropping two places on the World Watch List. Opposition has increased in family, church and community life. While there has been a drop in recorded incidents of violence, this must be understood in the context of ongoing conflicts\u2014such as the fighting in Tigray\u2014where it\u2019s difficult to differentiate between faith and ethnic/political related attacks.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nThe severity and form of persecution varies by region. For example, Christians in Amhara and Tigray are especially vulnerable to persecution from the Ethiopian Orthodox Church (EOC), whereas in places like Oromia, Afar and the Somali region persecution largely stems from Islamic extremists. The most severe cases of persecution tend to come in Gurage, Silte and Alaba, which are just south of the capital Addis Ababa.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help?\nOpen Doors works through local partners to strengthen Christians in Ethiopia with leadership and persecution survival training, economic empowerment projects, livelihood skills training, and women\u2019s and youth ministry.\nPopulation statistic: Johnson T M and Zurlo G A, eds., World Christian Database (Leiden/Boston: Brill, accessed April 2021).",

An Islamic State-affiliated group is seeking to establish an Islamic Caliphate in Mozambique. Their efforts have included numerous atrocities, burned churches and religious schools, and displacement of tens of thousands of people from the northern part of the country. These attacks have allowed religious persecution, which used to be limited almost entirely in the north, to spread. And drug cartels in some areas make the lives of Christians, especially church youth workers, more difficult. In addition to the violence, pressure has increased on believers in Mozambique.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nThe persecution of Christians is most severe in the northern areas due to Islamic State-affiliated extremists carrying out violent attacks as they seek to spread their influence and control.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help?\nThrough training and economic empowerment, Open Doors focuses on emergency support to Christians affected by increasing extremist violence in the north.\nPopulation statistic: Johnson T M and Zurlo G A, eds., World Christian Database (Leiden/Boston: Brill, accessed April 2021).",

The government continues to target even foreign Christians in its borders, along with the foreign spouses of Turkish citizens. It\u2019s not technically illegal for Muslims to convert to Christianity, but any Muslim who does decide to follow Jesus comes under immense strain from their families and communities, who often demand the convert return to Islam. These believers are sometimes forced to lead a double life and hide their conversion. Even Christians who did not convert from Islam are hardly regarded as full members of Turkish society and encounter all kinds of legal and bureaucratic obstructions. All Christians have limited access to state employment and experience discrimination in private employment, especially in jobs with ties to the government.\nMeet Hans-Jurgen Louven, who was forced to leave Turkey\n\u201cThe only reason I can think of for [forcing me to leave] is that we are people of faith, and at times we have shared our faith with the local people.\u201d\nWhat has changed this year?\nEven though it\u2019s decreased in score, Turkey continues its status as a place where Christians can expect to encounter significant opposition for their faith. Increasingly, Turkish identity is tied to Islam, so anyone outside of that brand of religious nationalism encounters suspicion and discrimination. All Christians are under pressure in Turkey, but converts from Islam are certainly the most vulnerable, along with Christian refugees from countries like Iran, Iraq and Syria.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nThe persecution against converts from Islam is greatest in the rural areas of Turkey. That\u2019s why many believers who were Muslim choose to live in cities where they have more freedom. Christians in more historical Christian traditions\u2014groups like the Armenian and Assyrian (Syriac) churches\u2014face higher pressure and hostility in Turkey\u2019s southeastern region.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help Christians in Turkey?\nOpen Doors raises worldwide prayer support for persecuted believers in Turkey.\nPopulation statistic: Johnson T M and Zurlo G A, eds., World Christian Database (Leiden/Boston: Brill, accessed April 2021).",

        "details": "What does persecution look like in Mexico?\nIn Mexico, criminal groups struggle for territorial control. Christians are perceived (and rightly so) to be against criminal operations and violence, and are therefore at constant risk of being targeted for elimination. In rural indigenous communities, anyone who turns from traditional religious beliefs can face rejection and punishment in the form of fines, imprisonment, and forced \u00a0displacement. As Christians hold fast to traditional, biblical views on issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, parental rights and religious liberty, they become less tolerated in the public square. Non-discrimination laws mean that any links between Christian faith and politics are placed under very strict legal scrutiny.\nMeet Pastor Imeldo\nWhen Pastor Imeldo returned from a few years living in the U.S., he was welcomed by his home village. He created a Bible study that grew to need a church building, which he built on family land. But when Christians came into town to meet at the church, officials closed it down and arrested Pastor Imeldo. After two days, the town\u2019s assembly ordered him to leave. He recalls someone telling him that day: \u201cImeldo, you have to understand that we want to preserve our customs, we don\u2019t want what you bring because then our traditions will disappear.\u201d\nWhat has changed this year?\nMexican criminals were able to take advantage of the socio-political instability surrounding the COVID-19 crisis to reinforce and increase their territorial dominance, generating greater vulnerability (and increased violence) for Christians. The COVID-19 context also encouraged the indigenous community authorities to act more harshly against those Christians refusing to adhere to traditional customs. Additionally, it\u2019s becoming more difficult for Christians to find a chance to express their viewpoints in the public square.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nCriminal networks that have spread throughout Mexico act as drivers of persecution wherever the church is perceived as a threat to their interests. Mexico\u2019s southern states are the main areas for clan oppression, violating the rights of Christians inside indigenous communities. Church buildings have been vandalized by those who have a radical commitment to secularism and are opposed to any Christian values.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help?\nOpen Doors is engaged in research and communication to raise awareness about the persecuted church in Mexico and to help the church cope with persecution. We also encourage advocacy to help address root causes of persecution at the local, federal and regional levels, as well as raise prayer support from the worldwide Church for persecuted believers. Finally, we develop training to help the Mexican church be aware of and respond biblically to persecution.\nPopulation statistic: Johnson T M and Zurlo G A, eds., World Christian Database (Leiden/Boston: Brill, accessed April 2021).",

Because of the totalitarian leadership structure, any perceived deviation from any group is treated with suspicion. This means authorities put significant pressure on Christians through tightening existing laws and strictly enforcing the ones that already exist, such as greatly restricting the public training of church leaders. The Russian Orthodox Church is registered and somewhat tolerated, since they don\u2019t usually reach out to the Tajik population. But Protestants are viewed with significant suspicion and are seen as extremists. Additionally, Tajikistan is predominantly Muslim, which means converts from Islam are at risk from their families and communities in addition to the broader persecution from the one-party state.\nMeet Pastor Bahrom, a church leader in Tajikistan\n\u201cEarly last year, my church was attacked and the church building was confiscated by the court. Our church is now gathering inside a shipping container.\u201d\nWhat has changed this year?\nThe pressure on Christians in Tajikistan has largely stayed the same from year to year, even as the ranking fell significantly\u2014the decrease in rank was mostly due to rising persecution scores for many other countries. The persecution continues to come from two primary sources: the totalitarian regime that rules the country, and Muslim-majority communities that oppose any deviation from Islam.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nAny Christian in Tajikistan may be at risk due to the government\u2019s widespread suspicion of believers. But Protestants are at greater risk than some historical denominations. Converts from Islam experience pressure from family, friends and community in greater amounts in rural areas\u2014cities are slightly safer for believers who left Islam.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help?\nOpen Doors provides immediate aid to Central Asian believers when they are imprisoned, excluded from families and communities, and deprived of livelihood and employment because of their faith in Christ.

The past year has seen a number of believers face fines for selling Christian literature and objects. The Russian Orthodox churches experience the fewest problems, as it doesn\u2019t tend to initiate contact with the Kazakh population.\nChristians from Muslim backgrounds also face opposition closer to home, from family, friends and neighbors.

Local mullahs (Muslim leaders) also preach against them.\nMeet \u201cJohn\u201d\nJohn is a member of Shanyrak church in Nur-Sultan.

The revised law also states that anyone meeting outside registered places of worship will need the state\u2019s approval before producing written religious material. However, the punishment for committing certain \u201ccrimes,\u201d including importing Christian literature without permission, will be reduced under the new changes.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nThe tight control of Christians by the Kazakh government can happen across the country. Pressure on converts from family, friends and community is stronger in rural areas.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help Christians in Central Asia?\nOpen Doors strengthens persecuted Christians in Central Asia by providing Bibles and Christian literature, training, socio-economic development projects, practical aid, and women, children and Youth ministries.\nPopulation statistic: Johnson T M and Zurlo G A, eds., World Christian Database (Leiden/Boston: Brill, accessed April 2021).",

        "details": "What does persecution look like in Nepal?\nThough Nepal is no longer an official Hindu state, most Christian persecution in Nepal comes from radical Hindu groups who want the country to return to Hinduism. Many of the Christians in Nepal are converts from Hinduism, and these converts experience significant pressure from their families and communities. If a family discovers a member is a Christian, the convert might be expelled from their family home or even violently attacked. Also limiting religious freedom are anti-conversion laws and the destruction and forced closers of churches. Churches where foreigners gather are treated with more tolerance, though members of some Protestant churches still experience significant pressure.\nChristians who are members of indigenous groups also face persecution. Nepal has a rich diversity of tribes and clans where ethnic cultures, traditions and rituals are seen as very important. Once people convert to Christianity, they stop taking part in many of these traditions and are considered outcasts by the community. They might also be subjected to violent forms of persecution.\nMeet \u201cKabita Khatri,\u201d whose husband left her after she came to faith in Jesus\n\u201cMy family members constantly pressured me to give up my faith. They stopped talking to me and didn\u2019t help me financially. But I never gave up. One day, my father-in-law gathered some villagers and provoked them against me. He told me to leave my house if I wouldn\u2019t leave my faith. But those threats didn\u2019t shake my faith. Then, he found another way to persecute me. He stopped providing electricity in my room. I had to use candles or a cell phone\u2019s light to light the house during the night. I was despised and left alone. But all these hardships couldn\u2019t waver my faith in Christ.\u201d\nWhat has changed this year?\nNepal continues to be a place filled with persecution for followers of Christ. Nepal\u2019s fall in rank belies its persecution score, which stayed nearly as high as last year. Despite a decrease in violence, pressure in almost every sphere of life went up, showing that daily life remains difficult for Christians, especially converts from Hinduism. Despite some good news\u2014the government allowed some Christian charities to help with COVID-19 relief\u2014the situation remains difficult for Nepal\u2019s believers.\nThere are no hotspots for persecution of Christians in Nepal, but pressure on converts is stronger in the countryside than in the urban areas.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help Christians in Nepal?\nOpen Doors works through partners in Nepal to support Christians with Bibles and discipleship materials, biblical training, socio-economic aid and advocacy.\nPopulation statistic: Johnson T M and Zurlo G A, eds., World Christian Database (Leiden/Boston: Brill, accessed April 2021).",

        "details": "What does persecution look like in Kuwait?\nIn Kuwait, conversion from Islam to another faith is not officially recognized and is likely to lead to legal problems in personal status and property matters. Converts to Christianity from Islam face discrimination and harassment from their family and community, intimidation from Islamist groups, and even police monitoring.\nExpatriate Muslims who convert to Christianity experience the same levels of pressure as they would face in their home countries, as they often live within their own national or ethnic communities.\nBecause of the potentially severe consequences, it is almost impossible for converts to reveal their new faith, which is why there are hardly any reports of Christians being killed or harmed for their faith.\nAlthough expatriate Christians are relatively free to worship, finding a place to meet is often difficult. Christians must be very careful when sharing their faith, since proselytizing is illegal and they could be expelled from the country.\nMeet \u201cJudah,\u201d a Christian living in the Arabian Peninsula\n\u201cThe Word of God is eaten here. People are so hungry for the Word that it just finds its way to them.\u201d\nWhat has changed this year?\nLittle has changed for Christians in Kuwait, despite the country dropping a place on the World Watch List. While expatriate believers remain relatively free to practice their faith, converts from Islam continue to face severe opposition from both their families and communities\u2014and, if anything, this hostility has only increased over the past year.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nChristian converts are most vulnerable to persecution, because Kuwaiti society is highly conservative and leaving Islam is regarded as a betrayal of the family and tribe. In many cases, converts are alienated from their families as a result of their conversion. Expatriate Christians with lower levels of skills are more likely to face discrimination and abuse, especially female domestic workers.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help?\nOpen Doors supports the body of Christ on the Arabian Peninsula by organizing prayer, distributing Scripture resources, and training believers and pastors.\nPopulation statistic: Johnson T M and Zurlo G A, eds., World Christian Database (Leiden/Boston: Brill, accessed April 2021).",

        "details": "What does persecution look like in Malaysia?\nEvery ethnic Malay is expected to be Muslim, according to the country\u2019s Constitution. Those who convert to Christianity break the law and run head first into severe pressure from their families and communities. Converts are seen as betrayers of all that Malay society values most. All non-Muslim religious groups are watched by the authorities, as are non-governmental organizations, but the greatest focus is on non-traditional Protestant groups because these groups are more likely to actively testify about their faith, which is illegal.\nTumultuous Malaysian politics in recent years have resulted in more of an emphasis on conservative Islam, and have made radical factions feel freer to make statements opposing religious and ethnic minorities, including Christians. Converts from Islam to Christianity experience the most pressure and hostility of any group in the country.\nMeet \u201cReina\u201d\nReina heard stories about Jesus and was fascinated. When a local partner gave her a Bible in her own language, her fascination turned to faith. But she was frustrated by not being able to share her faith effectively with her illiterate husband and children. Then the partner gave Reina a USB stick with a complete audio Bible in her language, plus a PDF copy of the Bible and videos of the four Gospels. Now she is able to share Jesus with her family in a way they can understand.\nWhat has changed this year?\nMalaysia continues to be a difficult place for Christians, particularly those who convert from Islam. As Malaysia swings more deeply toward radical Islamic belief and practice, the potential for Christian persecution increases. There is less tolerance, or even hope of tolerance, with the new government than in past years. To maintain order, the continued policy of preferential treatment for ethnic Malay people puts anyone outside Islam under tighter scrutiny.\nWho is most vulnerable to persecution?\nThere are no hotspots of persecution for Christians in Malaysia. However, the All non-Muslims are at risk in Malaysia. Though there are no prominent hot spots where persecution is greater, the pressure to conform is immense. Islamic missionary work among Christians is encouraged; even state-supported plans of conversion to Islam have been published.\nWhat does Open Doors do to help?\nOvert Christian work and ministry are not allowed in Malaysia\u2014but Open Doors recognizes that the greatest weapon in this or any other nation is intercessory prayer for the believers. Open Doors raises awareness of the situation for Christians in Malaysia and provides specific prayer points to help the worldwide Church remember and lift up Malay believers. We also work with ministry partners to supply and distributed Bibles and discipleship materials.\nPopulation statistic: Johnson T M and Zurlo G A, eds., World Christian Database (Leiden/Boston: Brill, accessed April 2021).",
